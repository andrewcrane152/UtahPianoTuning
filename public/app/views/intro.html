            <h4 class="text-center">Piano Specifications</h4>
						<hr>
                <p>- Nearly all pianos have 88 keys, but the number of strings inside of the piano varies by manufacturer and model.  The <em>average</em> number of strings in a piano is 220.</p>
                <p>- Each string in a piano is designed to maintain around 200lbs of tention, which equates to more than 40,000lbs of total string tention compressing the piano's support structure... this is enough tention to lift a mobile home off the ground!</p>
                <p>- The average piano string is designed to last approximately 50 years before it needs to be overstretched to maintain it's tension... similar to a rubber band that has been under constant tention for a prolonged amount of time.</p>
                <p>- Most early 1900's upright pianos did not have a middle pedal.  It was simply the asthetic appeal to the american consumers that caused piano manufacutrers to add the middle pedal.</p>
                <p>- While the middle pedal does have a defined purpose in grand pianos, the variety of functions performed by the middle pedal on upright pianos still vary greatly.</p>
                <p>- The moving parts inside a piano that make it work, or piano action, can be very complicated with as many as 40-60 parts per key; each part having a specific purpose.</p>
								<br>
						<hr>
            <h4 class="text-center">Origins of the Piano</h4>
						<hr>
                <p>- Bartholomeu Christophori is credited for inventing the Piano around the turn of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>- He was an inventor and a musician for an Italian magistrate who wanted an instrument that was similar to the harpsicord, but that could fluctuate in volume.
                <p>- It took more than a decade and seven different renditions before Christophori had a design that he and other musicians were pleased with.</p>
                <p>- He named his new instrument the <em>Piano Forte</em>  ...Italian for <em>Soft Loud</em>.</p>
                <p>- Christophori's design for has gone mostly unchanged to this day... more than 200 years later.</p>
								<br>
						<hr>
            <h4 class="text-center">Modern Pianos</h4>
						<hr>
                <p>- The upright piano became popular starting in the 1890's, and by 1910 well over 100 different piano manufacturers were selling pianos in the United States.  </p>
                <p>- During the first and second world wars the majority of those piano manufacturers converted to making wartime goods, or were forsed to close altogether.</p>
                <p>- It wasn't until the 1940's that the piano industry experienced a resurgence with the production of a cheaper, smaller piano called the Spinet, or Drop Action piano.</p>
                <p>- By the mid 1950's the piano become, once again, an american staple for in-home entertainment.</p>
                <p>- Today, piano technicians are called on to service all types of pianos, from brand new concert grands to family heirlooms from 1895.</p>
